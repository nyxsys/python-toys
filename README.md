This will hold a collection of all the random scripts I've made with python over the past semester or so.


## santaswitchV2
randomizer for secret santa

Even DUMB PEOPLE can use this this
-make a spreadsheet with a column entiled "Names" (of those participating) and "Wishlist" (of whatever it is that they want)

-slap a .csv styled spreadsheet in this thing called "naughty_list.csv"

-run the pythonscript!

-All of the assignments will now be in a folder called "assignment" right next to the script!
